Ruby Gem for parsing C++ header files.
This library is based on Nokogiri (http://nokogiri.org) and takes as input the xml files generated by Doxygen (www.doxygen.org).
Parsing with Doxygen allows us to parse even a set of non-compilable include files. This is very useful in case you need to extract metadata for a big library which won't normally compile because of being incomplete or needing further build configuration (think of Makefiles, Visual Studio and similar).
By using other tools which rely on a real C/C++ processor like gccxml or swig, you would normally get lots of compilation-related errors (which is undesired because we don't want to compile anything!). Doxyparser is, in such cases, the lean alternative.
